# OctoPrint-PrintTrack
This plugin is meant to help you keep track of your printers progress and status. Currently it will display the printers status in the tab of OctoPrint in the browser. There are custimization options to change how it is displayed and also has adjustable strings so you can translate them or just make them something else.  

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

#### Possible Future Features
_Do note that these features are not confirmed to be implemented but are some that I wish to research and attempt at putting in the plugin._  
* Percentage in the title bar while a current print job is active.  
* Notifications on a print fail, completion, or error.  

#### Reporting Issues & Improvments
If you encounter any issues or bugs with the plugin please feel free to create an issue on the repo. I also fully support additions to the plugin from third parties. If you have an idea or an already developed solution that would implement with the plugin well, please submit it to the github repo and I will gladly consider additions and contributions.
